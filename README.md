## Third Year Project

# Motivation

Peer-to-peer platforms are ubiquitous and will continue to grow rapidly. This is partially due to their low entry costs for users on both sides of the markets. Often, these markets do little upfront screening. As almost all types of transactions are carried out through online platforms, quality threshold and screeding should become a first-rate objective for any online platforms who want to thrive and grow. 


# Introduction

This project attempts to answer two questions that haven't yet been answered in the literature to my knowledge.
1. Why do some platforms in two-sided markets have minimum quality thresholds and others do not?
1. What is the optimal threshold a platform should adopt if it decides to implement a threshold?
